## Inspiration
Every student should have the opportunity to continue their education journey after high school. No student should give up on their dreams of getting into University due to the lack of resources or guidance.
Together as a group of college students of different backgrounds who understand the struggle of college applications, envision giving back and sharing our experience to help aspiring students with their education.
The overall goal of our project is to help high school/ college students aiming to get into 4-year institutions find resources and connect with other students.
We hope to achieve our goal with UniBridge.

## What it does
Our website is a platform where all students can come together to share each others' stories to guide others, super user-friendly and easy-to-access tools and resources all in one place, and more importantly direct students and connect them with what they need to get to their goals.

Features included are:
1) Support with student portfolios and resumes
2) Academic Discussion and Forums 
3) Volunteer Opportunities
4) Scholarship and Funding Resources 
5) Data-driven insights
6) Chat-bot for 24-hour Support

## How we built it
Built by a group of students by splitting the features to work on for both the back-end and the front-end, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with the use of NPL.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenges were adapting to new technologies and languages as some of us are new to some development of features we were trying to implement. Time was also a challenge that we struggled with.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
To be able to deliver the website by interconnecting all the different languages and using AI in some of our features!

## What we learned
We learnt about website designs and designing the features we can add within the timeframe while delivering the best results,using different languages and making sure to connect them for the final product. 

## What's next for UniBridge
We hope to further develop this website and launch it into the world!
